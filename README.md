Educates Workshop Templates
===========================

This repository holds templates for creating workshops to be hosted using
Educates. For detailed instructions on how to create workshops using these
templates see the [Educates
documentation](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/educates-docs).

Note that if creating a repository using GitHub's repository template feature,
you need to wait until the GitHub action triggered upon repository creation has
been run before creating a checkout of the repository. This is because the
GitHub action will rewrite the initial repository content with customized
workshop content.
